#### Analysis of Algorithms
- Asymptotic Analysis : We evaluate the performance of the algorithms in terms of the input size (we don't measure the actual running time).
- We calculate how does the time (and space) taken by an algorithm increases with input size.
- Asymptotic analysis is not perfect but thats the best way available for analyzing an algorithm.
- We have three cases to analyze an algorithm :
    1. Worst case :
      - we calculate the upper bound on the running time of an algorithm
      - done in most of the cases
    2. Average case :
      - we take all possible inputs and calculate computing time for all possible inputs
      - sum all the calculated values and divide the sum by total number of inputs.
      - the average case analysis is not easy to do in most of the practical cases and it is rarely done.
    3. Best case :
      - we calculate the lower bound on the running time of an algorithm
      - bogus, it is of no use.
